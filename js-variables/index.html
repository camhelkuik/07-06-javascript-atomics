  <h2>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h2>
  <p>Variables are useful because you can call the variable name instead of having to retype the information that the variable holds. </p>
  
  <h2>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h2>
  <p>The advantages of hairColor is that it is very descriptive of what that variable is representing. If I just used hc I might forget what the variable's information is. One disadvantage might be the length of the variable or remembering the different cases used. </p>
  
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h2>
  <p>We might be able to use variables with console.log to debug.</p>
  
  <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
  <p>Var is used to declare the variable and it's value. By just writing the variable name you are calling the variable. </p>
  
  <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
  <p>An error is logged to the console. The html still runs and all the console.logs before the unassigned variable gets logged, but an error message is logged where the variable is that states that the variable is not defined. It then does not run or log anything after the error. </p>
