  <h2> Apart from changing your loop headers, what other changes do you need to make for each?</h2>
  <p>The for loop requires you to put the parameters like the count, count <= 10, and how much to increment or decrement by next to the for loop.></p>
  
  <h2>Given that you use either loop structure interchangeably, what do the different loop structures seem suited for?</h2>
  <p>The for loop seems already set up to do incrementing and decrementing. The while loop could do this and do booleans.</p>
