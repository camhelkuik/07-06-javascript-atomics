  <h1>JS Atomic 08A</h1>
  
  <h2>What does this program look like if done with a while loop? With a for loop? Which is better?</h2>
  <p>While loop seems easier and straight forward.</p>
  
  <h2>Did you use == or ===? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>I used !==. I kept getting an error when trying to use !===.</p>
