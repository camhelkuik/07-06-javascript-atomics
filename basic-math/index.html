  <h1>JS Atomic 04</h1>
  
  <h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "Error 404"? How about "404 Error"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
  <p>Error 404 will return NaN not a number. 404 Error will return just the 404. The incoming string needs to have the number first.</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
  <p>It will take the input, but where the numbers should be it returns NaN. It will still run the alerts and such, but all of the totals will be NaN.</p>
  
  <h2>Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?</h2>
  <p>the increment and decrement will come in handy during loops.</p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
