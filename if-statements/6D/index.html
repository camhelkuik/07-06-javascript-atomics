  <h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
  <p>No because each if statement is on it's own. If we did if else statements then it would matter.</p>
  
  <h2>When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?</h2>
  <p>I used || because I want it to alert something only if the answer fulfills one of the ages not if it fullfills all of the ages because then it will never alert that statement.</p>
  
  <h2>What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>
  <p>String or no input produce a NaN. It may not be important for this exercise, but it could be for other things. It is not possible because it would not match the conditional. </p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
