  <h1>JS Atomic 06B</h1>
  
  <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
  <p>Yes it does matter if it matches exactly. Part of a good password if having different cases througout the password.</p>
  
  <h2>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
  <p>I used === because the entered password will have to be exactly the same as the hardcoded one. I experimented with == and it seemed to work as well as ===. I prefer === because I understand that there is no "false" truth. A single = does not work because it is assigning the answer to equal the password so it will always be true.</p>
  
  <h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
  <p>The sensitive information is not safe. Someone could purposfully or accidently come upon that information. It is easy to find.</p>
