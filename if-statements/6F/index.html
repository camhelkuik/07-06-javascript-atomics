  <h1>JS Atomic 06F</h1>
  
  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h2>
  <p>My prediction is that it will try running the program with the NaN and the results will be that it is not a valid triangle. My prediction was correct.</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h2>
  <p>If one or more of the lengths are 0 then it will run the program and the triangle is not valid. My prediction was correct.</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h2>
  <p>If one or more of the legs are negative it will run the program and the triangle is not valid. My prediction was correct.</p>
  
  <h2>Assuming errors exist, note that all of these errors come from the user inputting one or more invalid values. What are some strategies you might use to prevent this from happening (or at least to prevent those invalid values from being used)</h2>
  <p>Check to see if what the user inputs is NaN or negative and ask them to re-enter a value that is positive.</p>
