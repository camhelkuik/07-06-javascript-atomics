  <h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
  <p>Yes, if you go from youngest to oldest it will never get to the end of the if else statement due to how you have to write the age and greater or less than statements.</p>
  
  <h2>When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?</h2>
  <p></p>
  
  <h2>What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>
  <p></p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
