  <h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
  <p>The data-type for all of the information is a string, even if what was entered was a number.</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
  <p>The variable is assigned an empty string.</p>
  
  <h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>
  <p>I choose variable names that were descriptive of the information I wanted from the user.</p>
  
  <h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
  <p>If I changed the question completely I would need to change the variable name. If I changed the order of the questions I would need to change the variable names also.</p>
  
  <h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
  <p>Most websites use html forms to collect information from the user. An advantage of a form would be that it is apart of the web page you are on and does not close when finished. If you want someone to be able to sign up for a newsletter it would be nice to have that as a prompt so it would close after. </p>
  
  <h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
  <p>Using Javascript you can only have a single field prompt, but possibly with jQuery you could make a multi-field prompt.</p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>If there a way to have a user value be an integer instead of a string? Would it be similar to Ruby where you add .to_i?</p>
