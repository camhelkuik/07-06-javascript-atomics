  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>Alert opens up a pop up window that has the text and then lets you clost the window. Console.log is used for debugging. It logs or adds to the console when something is run. </p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>Alert would be good for an error to make sure that the user is aware of the error. It could be good to let the user know when they are about to exit a secure page. </p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>If you have an alert for every submission of information, or every action on a page has an alert.</p>
  
  <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p>It would not make sense because it only logs things to the console, which a user may not know how to get to and would most likely not think to look there for information.</p>
    
  <h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p>It would be helpful for debugging, to see if certain parts of the code was run.</p>
  
  <h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?
  </h2>
  <p>The console.log runs after the user clicks to close the dialog box. I was able to open the Javascript console in my browser and when I refreshed the browser the console cleared itself. The first dialog box opened and as I clicked to close it, I watched the console and the console.log statements then appeared in the console before the last dialog box opened. \</p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>What other kinds of tools are there to tell the user things?</p>
  <p>Is there another or better way to debug Javascript than using the console.log?</p>
